═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## ❌ PROBLEM:

You cannot edit the "Add Matcher" settings in LiveKit Cloud Dashboard.
This means self-hosted agents cannot receive job requests automatically.

**Email Template:**
```
Subject: Request Agent Dispatch Configuration - No Dashboard Access

Hi LiveKit team,

I'm running a self-hosted voice agent but cannot edit the agent dispatch 
configuration in my dashboard. The "Add Matcher" option is not available/editable.

My Project Details:
- LiveKit URL: wss://aiinterviewprod-anr5bvh0.livekit.cloud
- Agent Name: attar-travel-assistant  
- Worker ID: AW_CHSkbtBFVPt6
- Region: Singapore South East

Request:
Could you please configure agent dispatch for my self-hosted agent?

Configuration needed:
- Agent Name: attar-travel-assistant
- Room Pattern Matcher: .*  (all rooms)
- Participant Pattern Matcher: .*  (all participants)

Alternatively, could you grant me edit access to the Agent Dispatch section?

Thank you!
```

**Expected Response Time:** 24-48 hours

**They will:** Configure the dispatcher for you OR grant you access

## 🎯 SOLUTION 2: Deploy to LiveKit Cloud (EASIEST)

Instead of self-hosting, deploy your agent to LiveKit Cloud.

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No dashboard configuration needed
- ✅ Automatic dispatch
- ✅ Auto-scaling
- ✅ Managed infrastructure

**How to Deploy:**

1. Package your agent:
```bash
cd /Users/apple/AI-Travel-agency/AI-Voice-Agent-Travel-/Production/vapi-voicebot
zip -r agent.zip livekit_voice_agent_complete.py SYSTEM_PROMPT.py .env
```

2. Go to: https://cloud.livekit.io
3. Navigate: **Agents → Deploy**
4. Upload: `agent.zip`
5. Configure environment variables
6. Deploy

**Done!** LiveKit Cloud handles everything automatically.

## 🎯 SOLUTION 3: Use Vapi.ai Instead

Since you already have Vapi code set up, you could use Vapi for the voice 
agent instead of LiveKit.

**Your Vapi System:**
- ✅ Already working
- ✅ No dashboard config needed
- ✅ Easy integration
- ✅ Built-in dispatch

**Vapi Files You Have:**
- `vapivoice/` folder with complete Vapi system
- `vapi-with-visual-cards.html` - Working Vapi widget

**To Use Vapi:**
```bash
cd vapivoice
./start_vapi.sh
```

Then integrate with Vapi's dashboard (much easier than LiveKit).

## 🎯 SOLUTION 4: Wait for Dashboard Access

LiveKit may be updating your account permissions.

**Check:**
- Try logging out and back in
- Try a different browser
- Check if your account plan includes agent dispatch
- Verify you're an admin on the project
